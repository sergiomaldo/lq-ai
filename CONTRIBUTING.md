# Contributing to LQ.AI

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This document covers contributions to **code, infrastructure, deployment recipes, and general project documentation**. Skills containing legal substance follow a different process documented in [`skills/CONTRIBUTING.md`](skills/CONTRIBUTING.md) — that path includes attestation requirements and practicing-attorney review that don't apply to engineering work.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legalquants/lq-ai.git
cd lq-ai
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with at least one LLM provider API key (or use local profile)
docker compose up -d              # Mode 1
# OR
docker compose --profile local up -d   # Mode 2
```

**Running backend tests in Docker** (recommended when you don't want a local Python venv):

```bash
# api/Dockerfile.dev installs [dev] extras (pytest, respx, pytest-cov, …)
# on top of the production image so the test suite runs in-container.
docker build -f api/Dockerfile.dev -t lq-ai-api-dev api/
docker run --rm lq-ai-api-dev python -m pytest tests/ -x
```

The production image (`api/Dockerfile`) does **not** install dev extras to keep
the runtime surface area minimal. Use `Dockerfile.dev` for any work that requires
running the test suite inside a container.

For backend development without Docker, dependencies are managed with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (per [ADR 0023](docs/adr/0023-uv-lockfiles-gateway-api.md)):
For ordinary reproducible setup, use `uv sync --frozen --extra dev`. It creates
`.venv/` from the committed `uv.lock` without changing the lockfile. If you
intentionally change dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock` in that
subsystem and commit the updated lockfile — CI gates on `uv lock --check`.

Run each subsystem example from the repository root in its own terminal:

```bash
# Backend
make install-api
cd api && .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

```bash
# Inference Gateway
make install-gateway
cd gateway && .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

```bash
# Web (OpenWebUI fork)
make install-web                    # installs the committed package-lock.json
cd web && npm run dev
```

When deliberately changing Web dependencies, use `npm install <package>` (or
`npm uninstall <package>`) and commit both `web/package.json` and
`web/package-lock.json`. Use `npm ci` for ordinary setup and verification.

Run the test suite before submitting:

```bash
# From the repository root
make lint          # Python ruff/mypy + Web scoped Svelte check
make format-check  # Python formatting check
make test          # Python local-loop suites + Web Vitest

# Web checks can also be run independently
make web-check     # npm run check:lq-ai
make web-test      # npm run test:frontend -- --run
```

## What to work on

> **Working with an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, …)?** Start it on the [cold-start guide for coding agents](docs/contribute/coding-agent-onboarding.md) — read-order, the build loop, dev-environment hard rules, and how to take a roadmap item to a merged PR.

The project's [Deferred Enhancements list (PRD §9)](docs/PRD.md#9-deferred-enhancements-and-identified-future-work) catalogs ~50+ bounded enhancements where the architectural slot exists and the implementation is well-defined. Items tagged **P1** are particularly welcome for v1.5+. A few that are well-shaped for first-time contributors:

- **DE-013 Saved Prompts Library** (S effort) — per-user saved prompts in a sidebar; CRUD plus promote-to-skill.
- **DE-015 Voice / Dictation Input** (S) — Web Speech API toggle on the chat input.
- **DE-031 Reverse proxy / TLS recipes** (S) — document Caddy / Traefik / nginx integration patterns.
- **DE-103 IP allowlisting and geo-restriction** (S) — configurable IP allowlist for the web app and Word add-in.
- **DE-105 Outbound proxy support** (S) — `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` configuration in the Inference Gateway.

For larger items (M and L effort), please **file an issue first** to discuss approach before opening a PR. We do not want anyone to invest weeks of work that turns out to conflict with an architectural choice or another in-flight contribution.

For features not on the deferred-enhancements list, please file an issue describing the use case and the proposed approach. Pull requests for unfiled features are welcome but at higher risk of bouncing if they conflict with the project's direction.

---

## Pull request process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a branch from `main`. Branch names should describe the work: `feat/saved-prompts`, `fix/citation-engine-empty-result`, `docs/clarify-tier-config`.
2. **Make your changes** following the code style and testing requirements below.
3. **Add or update tests** covering the change. Pytest coverage target is 80%, but
   current PR CI does not enforce a coverage threshold or no-decrease rule.
4. **Update documentation** — the PRD, README, skill-authoring guide, or capability docs as relevant. If your change affects user-facing behavior, the docs need to reflect it.
5. **Sign your commits** per the DCO requirement (see [Sign-off](#sign-off-developer-certificate-of-origin) below). PRs without DCO sign-off cannot be merged.
6. **Open the PR** with a description that explains what changed, why, and how to verify. Link to any relevant issue or DE-### entry in the PRD.
7. **Respond to review** — maintainers will review within ~5 business days for most PRs, faster for security or bug fixes. Substantive review feedback usually requires changes; small style nits can be deferred to follow-ups.
8. **Current PR CI must pass** — API runs `uv lock --check`, `ruff check`, and
   `ruff format --check` for `api/` and `scripts/`, `mypy app`, and `pytest -q`
   with pgvector Postgres; Gateway runs `uv lock --check`, ruff check/format,
   `mypy app`, and `pytest -q`; Web runs `npm run check:lq-ai` and `npm run
   test:frontend -- --run`; the Release image job runs
   `scripts/release-image-check.sh` (the skills-corpus guard in
   `api/Dockerfile.release`). The path-triggered Stack smoke workflow also runs on
   PRs that change the specified API/Gateway/Web dependency manifests and locks,
   Dockerfiles, compose, API migrations, its script, or its workflow. PRs with
   failing CI are not merged.
9. **At least one maintainer approval** is required to merge. For changes affecting multiple subsystems, two approvals are preferred.

Squash-and-merge is the default; merge commits are reserved for cases where the per-commit history meaningfully aids future debugging.

---

## Sign-off (Developer Certificate of Origin)

LQ.AI uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) — not a CLA. The DCO is a lightweight assertion that you have the right to contribute the work under the project's Apache 2.0 license. Industry standard, sufficient legal cover, no separate paperwork.

Every commit must be signed off:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This adds a trailer to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The `git config user.email` you sign off as must match the email associated with
your GitHub account or be in your verified emails list. Project policy requires
DCO sign-off on every commit; PRs with unsigned commits cannot be merged.

If you forget to sign off, amend your commits before pushing:

```bash
git commit --amend -s --no-edit          # most recent commit
git rebase --signoff main                 # all commits since main diverged
```

## Code style

### Python (`api/`, `gateway/`, scripts)

- **Formatter:** `ruff format` (Black-compatible). CI rejects unformatted code.
- **Linter:** `ruff check` with the project's `ruff.toml` config. Most pyflakes / pycodestyle / pyupgrade / bugbear rules enforced.
- **Type checker:** `mypy` in strict mode for the gateway; standard mode for the backend (strict-mode migration is a tracked enhancement, DE-### TBD).
- **Type annotations:** required on all new public functions and class methods. Internal helpers can omit return types where obvious; public API contracts require full annotations.
- **Imports:** sorted by `ruff` (isort-compatible). Standard library first, then third-party, then local.
- **Docstrings:** required on public modules, classes, and functions in the gateway and backend. Format: triple-quoted, summary line, blank line, detail. Descriptive variable names reduce the need for inline comments.
- **Async:** prefer `async def` for I/O-bound functions; use `httpx.AsyncClient` rather than `requests`. Sync helpers are fine for CPU-bound or test code.
- **Exceptions:** raise typed errors from each subsystem's `app.errors` module ([api/app/errors.py](api/app/errors.py), [gateway/app/errors.py](gateway/app/errors.py)) — `LQAIError` and its subclasses. Do not raise bare `Exception`. Per [ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-error-handling.md), the two subsystems each ship parallel hierarchies; the cross-subsystem contract is the error-code enum in the OpenAPI sketches plus the conformance test in [`tests/test_error_code_contract.py`](tests/test_error_code_contract.py).

### JavaScript / TypeScript (`web/`)

- **Formatter:** Prettier with the project's `.prettierrc`. Run it deliberately on
  files you change; the current PR workflow does not run a Web formatting gate.
- **Static check:** `npm run check:lq-ai` runs the scoped Svelte/TypeScript check
  used by current PR CI. The inherited full-fork `npm run lint` script mutates
  files and is not the PR static-check contract.
- **TypeScript:** required for new files; gradual migration of legacy `.js` files welcome but not required for unrelated changes.
- **Framework:** SvelteKit. The `web/` codebase is a fork of OpenWebUI, which is a SvelteKit app — extensions and customizations stay in Svelte. Do **not** introduce React into `web/`. The Word add-in (`word-addin/`, M3) uses Office.js with React; the `web/` codebase does not.
- **Component conventions:** match the OpenWebUI conventions for shared components; use the project's design system primitives rather than ad-hoc Tailwind.

### Configuration files

- **YAML:** 2-space indent. Use anchors and aliases sparingly; prefer explicit duplication over clever YAML.
- **TOML:** for Python project configuration (`pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`).
- **Markdown:** GitHub-flavored. Headings use `#`, not `===`. Wrap at ~100 chars in prose; do not wrap inside code blocks.

### Commit messages

- **Imperative mood.** "Add tier-config endpoints" not "Added tier-config endpoints".
- **Subject under ~70 chars**; body wrapped at ~72 chars.
- **Reference issues** in the body: `Closes #123`, `Refs DE-103`.
- **No marketing language** in commit messages. Describe what changed and why; the changelog is for marketing.

## Testing requirements

The project takes testing seriously because the substantive correctness of the legal-AI work product depends on it.

### Coverage target

Pytest coverage target is **80%** across `api/` and `gateway/`. Current PR CI does
not enforce a coverage threshold or no-decrease rule. New code should be covered
by tests; bug fixes should include a regression test that fails before the fix
and passes after.

### Test categories

- **Unit tests** — fast, no external dependencies. Mock the Inference Gateway, the database, and any provider APIs.
- **Integration tests** — API PR tests run with a real pgvector Postgres service.
  These exercise flows that need database behavior rather than mocks alone.
- **Provider-integration tests** — marked `provider` and require provider API
  keys. They are not a separate current PR CI job; run them locally when a change
  specifically affects provider integration and credentials are available.
- **End-to-end tests** — browser end-to-end coverage is not part of the current PR workflow.
- **Fuzzing** — continuous fuzzing is not part of the current PR workflow.

### Release image skills-corpus check

`api/Dockerfile.release` bakes the repo-root `skills/` corpus into the published api image, and half of that corpus is the `skills/community` submodule. The Dockerfile fails the build unless at least one `skills/community/skills/*/SKILL.md` manifest is present, so a checkout without submodules cannot publish an image that is silently missing those skills. CI runs the check on every PR (`release-image-checks` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). It builds only the `skills` stage of the Dockerfile, so it needs no dependency install and finishes in seconds.

Run it locally after touching `api/Dockerfile.release`, `.gitmodules`, or the release checkout in `.github/workflows/release.yml` (needs docker and a recursive checkout):

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/release-image-check.sh
```

It asserts that this checkout bakes the community manifests, and that an empty submodule directory, a submodule root carrying only README and LICENSE, and a `skills/` tree with no manifest each stop the build at the guard. Set `FULL_IMAGE=1` to also build the complete api release image (slow; pulls docling and torch).

### Stack smoke test (build + boot the whole stack)

The suites above run in-process and never boot the real servers, so they miss whole classes of breakage: a server that won't start (uvicorn), a Redis client that fails on connect (the arq workers), a lazily-imported dependency that breaks (docling is only imported inside ingest jobs), or an OpenWebUI-core build failure (the `web` production build is outside the scoped typecheck and the Vitest suite). The stack smoke test closes that gap by building every default-profile image, booting the full compose stack, waiting for every healthcheck, probing the api/gateway/web health endpoints and the ingest worker's lazy imports, then holding for a soak period and failing if any container restarted.

CI runs it (`.github/workflows/stack-smoke.yml`) on PRs that touch dependency manifests — `pyproject.toml`, `web/package.json`/`package-lock.json`, Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml` — which covers dependabot PRs, plus pushes to `main` and manual dispatch.

**Run it locally** before submitting a change that could break the stack at build or boot time (a dependency bump, a Dockerfile or compose edit, a new migration):

```bash
./scripts/stack-smoke.sh
```

Notes for local runs:

- **No provider API keys are needed** — nothing in the smoke performs inference. If you have no `.env`, the script writes one with dummy secrets; an existing `.env` is respected.
- It operates on the same compose project as your dev stack and recreates the containers (`--force-recreate`) so the restart-count assertion starts from zero. Named volumes (Postgres data, MinIO objects, model caches) are untouched. As always, never `docker compose down -v`.
- A cold build needs roughly 25 GB of free disk and 20–30 minutes (the api image pulls docling/torch); warm rebuilds are much faster.
- Tune with `SOAK_SECONDS` (default 75) and `WAIT_TIMEOUT` (default 900) environment variables.
- **On failure** the script reports which phase failed (build / boot / probes / soak), each container's state (exit code, OOM kill, restart count), the last healthcheck probe outputs, disk space, and the last 60 log lines per service; full compose logs land in `stack-smoke-logs/` (gitignored). CI additionally uploads that directory as a workflow artifact and writes the state dump to the job summary.
- It proves "builds, migrates, boots, and holds" — it does **not** prove features work. Feature-level verification still belongs to the test categories above.

### Test stack conventions (Python)

Locked-in choices so new tests don't drift across `api/` and `gateway/`. Changes to these defaults need a PR with rationale.

- **Test runner:** `pytest`. No alternative.
- **Async tests:** `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` configured in `pyproject.toml`. Async test functions are written as `async def test_*(...)` without a per-test decorator. We picked `pytest-asyncio` over `anyio`'s test plugin because the project's runtime is asyncio-only — we never need trio compatibility, and `pytest-asyncio` has the larger ecosystem.
- **HTTP client in tests:** `httpx.AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport` for in-process FastAPI tests; no `TestClient`. Real-network calls in tests are forbidden outside the `provider`-marked tests.
- **Test database:** session-scoped fixture runs Alembic migrations once against a per-CI-run Postgres database; per-test fixture wraps each test in a transaction that rolls back on teardown. No truncation between tests; no test-specific migrations. Both subsystems share `tests/conftest.py` patterns.
- **Test data:** factory pattern using `polyfactory` for Pydantic models; no hand-written fixture dictionaries except for canonical examples that stay readable inline.
- **Provider mocking:** `respx` for httpx-level mocks; record-replay fixtures for end-to-end provider flows under `tests/fixtures/providers/`.
- **Time and randomness:** `freezegun` for time, `random.seed(0)` at the top of any test that uses randomness. Flaky tests are not tolerated; if you find one, fix it or skip it with a tracked issue.

### Test markers

Standard markers are declared in each subsystem's `pyproject.toml` where
applicable, so `pytest --strict-markers` rejects typos:

| Marker | Purpose | Default behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `unit` | Pure unit, no I/O | Included in current PR pytest jobs |
| `integration` | Hits Postgres, Redis, MinIO, or the Gateway | Included in current PR pytest jobs; API CI supplies pgvector Postgres |
| `provider` | Hits a real LLM provider; requires API key | Run intentionally with credentials; no dedicated current PR job |
| `slow` | Takes > 5s; usually integration with realistic data | Skipped by `make test`; current PR pytest has no marker filter |
| `e2e` | Browser end-to-end (currently declared for API only) | Not run by the current PR workflow |

`pytest -m "not provider and not slow"` is the local-loop default; `make test` runs this.

### JavaScript/TypeScript tests (`web/`)

The OpenWebUI fork is SvelteKit. New unit and component tests use **Vitest**
(Svelte's standard). Don't introduce Jest unless there's a concrete reason —
Vitest is closer to SvelteKit's tooling and has fewer ESM-vs-CJS pitfalls.

- **Component tests:** `@testing-library/svelte` with Vitest.
- **Type checking in tests:** test files are `.ts` / `.svelte` and pass `npm run check:lq-ai`.
- **Snapshot testing:** discouraged for component output; preferred for stable structured data (e.g., backend-returned shapes).

### When to write what kind of test

| Change type | Required tests |
|---|---|
| Bug fix | Regression test (unit if possible; integration if the bug is multi-component) |
| New API endpoint | Unit tests for the handler logic + integration test exercising the endpoint end-to-end + OpenAPI schema-conformance test |
| New provider adapter | Provider-integration tests (gated behind `-m provider`); unit tests with mocked provider responses for the request/response shape |
| New skill (engineering side; the skill content itself goes through the skills/CONTRIBUTING.md path) | A worked-example test verifying the skill renders and produces structured output of the expected shape |
| New deployment recipe | Documented steps + a CI verification job that runs the recipe in a clean environment |
| Documentation only | No new tests; no current Markdown CI gate |

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not file a public GitHub issue**. Follow the disclosure process in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md):

1. Email security@legalquants.com (or the address documented in `SECURITY.md` at the time you read this) with a description of the vulnerability and reproduction steps. GPG key available at the URL in `SECURITY.md`.
2. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
3. We will fix critical issues within 30 days and coordinate disclosure timing with you.
4. After fix and disclosure, the advisory is published on GitHub Security Advisories with credit to the reporter (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

The project includes safe-harbor language committing not to pursue legal action against good-faith security researchers who follow the coordinated-disclosure process.

For security-affecting *changes* (not vulnerabilities — changes you want to propose to the project that have security implications), file a normal PR but flag the security implications in the description and tag a maintainer for direct review. Examples: changes to authentication flows, audit logging, the Inference Gateway's tier-derivation logic, the Anonymization Layer, encryption configuration, supply-chain artifacts.

---

## Documentation expectations

If your change affects user-facing behavior, the documentation must be updated in the same PR. The relevant docs:

- **`docs/PRD.md`** — the canonical specification. Capability changes go here. PRD edits should follow the existing structure (see PRD's own changelog convention).
- **`README.md`** — the front-door doc. Update if your change affects how users get started, what the project does, or the high-level capability list.
- **`docs/skill-authoring-guide.md`** — if your change affects how skills work or what's expected of skill authors.
- **`docs/playbook-authoring-guide.md`** — if your change affects Playbooks.
- **`docs/deployment-cookbook.md`** — if your change affects deployment.
- **`docs/compliance/`** — if your change affects compliance posture (e.g., new audit-log field, new tier-handling logic, new data-flow path that affects a control mapping).
- **`docs/security/`** — if your change affects security posture (e.g., new dependency that affects the SBOM story, new endpoint that affects the threat model).
- **API changes** — the OpenAPI schema is generated from the FastAPI handlers; update handlers, run `make openapi` to regenerate the schema, and commit the regenerated schema.

PRs that change behavior without updating docs will be asked to add the doc changes before merge.

## Porting skills from external sources

Skills may be ported from external corpora (law firm knowledge bases, open-source legal-AI repositories, academic datasets, etc.) if the licence and provenance allow. Porting is a special case of the skill-contribution workflow documented in [`skills/CONTRIBUTING.md`](skills/CONTRIBUTING.md); the additional requirements below apply **in addition** to the standard skill-authoring steps.

### Attestation

Every ported skill PR description must include an attestation paragraph signed by a practicing attorney (the PR author, a co-author, or a named legal reviewer). Template:

> I, [Name], a licensed attorney in [jurisdiction(s)], attest that:
>
> 1. I have reviewed the ported skill against the original source material and confirm the substance is accurately represented.
> 2. The upstream licence ([SPDX identifier]) permits this use under the terms stated in NOTICES.md.
> 3. Any jurisdictional limitations of the source material are reflected in the skill's `jurisdiction:` frontmatter field.
> 4. This skill does not constitute legal advice and is labelled accordingly in the skill frontmatter.

Pull requests without a complete attestation paragraph will not be merged. Agents do not attest — the human contributor is the attesting party.

### Provenance preservation

The upstream source must be recorded in three places:

1. **Skill frontmatter** — add a `source:` key under the `lq_ai:` extension block:

   ```yaml
   lq_ai:
     source:
       uri: "https://example.com/original-skill-repo"
       license: "Apache-2.0"
       retrieved_at: "2026-05-14"
   ```

2. **NOTICES.md** — add a row to the per-skill provenance table at the repo root. See [`NOTICES.md`](NOTICES.md) for the column format.

3. **Commit message** — include the upstream URI in the commit body:
   `Ported from https://example.com/original-skill-repo (Apache-2.0).`

### Attribution requirements

If the upstream source requires attribution (e.g., a CC-BY licence), the attribution text must appear in:
- The skill's `SKILL.md` under an "Attribution" heading.
- The NOTICES.md row for that skill.

Questions about licence compatibility should be directed to the maintainer team before opening the PR. When in doubt, do not port — create a new skill inspired by the source instead.

---

## Reviewer expectations

Reviewers will look for:

1. **Correctness** — does the change do what it claims to do?
2. **Tests** — does the change have adequate test coverage?
3. **Style** — does the change follow the project's conventions?
4. **Clarity** — is the change readable and maintainable?
5. **Compatibility** — does the change preserve backward compatibility, or if not, is the breaking change documented and justified?
6. **Security implications** — does the change introduce new attack surface, weaken existing protections, or change the data-flow path? If so, has it been thought through?
7. **Performance implications** — does the change add latency or memory overhead in the request path? If so, is the trade-off documented?
8. **Documentation** — has the relevant doc been updated?

Reviewers are also expected to be:

- **Constructive** — feedback is about the work, not the contributor. Suggest specific changes rather than abstract complaints.
- **Timely** — initial review within 5 business days for most PRs; follow-up review within 2 days. Communicate if you cannot meet that timeline.
- **Decisive** — approve, request changes, or comment with a specific question. Do not leave PRs in limbo.

If a PR has been waiting for review longer than the timeline above, please ping a maintainer in the PR or in `#contributors` on Discord.
