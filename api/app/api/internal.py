"""Internal service-to-service routes (gateway → backend).

Per ADR 0007 (Skill prompt assembly), the gateway needs to read skill
content from the backend's registry during prompt assembly. The
user-facing ``GET /api/v1/skills/{name}`` endpoint is gated by
``get_active_user`` (B1 bearer + B2 password-change gate) and is
inappropriate for service-to-service traffic — the gateway has no
user.

This module exposes a parallel ``GET /api/v1/internal/skills/{name}``
endpoint authenticated by the existing ``X-LQ-AI-Gateway-Key`` shared
secret. Trust-domain separation: user-facing endpoints stay under
user-token auth; internal endpoints stay under shared-secret auth.
The two never mix on a single route. The response shape is identical
to the user-facing endpoint so the gateway-side client can reuse the
same response model.

Scope (M1):

* ``GET /api/v1/internal/skills/{name}`` — full Skill detail. Same body
  as the user-facing route.
* No ``GET /api/v1/internal/skills`` (list) — the gateway never enumerates,
  it only fetches the specific skill names a request has attached.

Auth posture
------------

The header check is constant-time (``secrets.compare_digest``). A missing
or wrong key returns 401. The gateway-key is shared with the backend via
``LQ_AI_GATEWAY_KEY`` (already set on both services for the
backend → gateway direction; reused here in the reverse direction).

If the operator has not configured ``LQ_AI_GATEWAY_KEY`` (i.e., it is
the empty string), the route returns 500 with
``code=internal_error`` and a clear log line — accepting the call
unauthenticated would be a security hole. This matches the
``LQ_AI_GATEWAY_KEY`` is required posture documented in
``docker-compose.yml``.

    callers that don't care about user-scope (e.g., admin tooling)
    omit ``user_id`` and get the registry view directly.

    Cache key strategy (D8.1b decision): the gateway-side cache stays
    keyed on ``(name, user_id)``. Team-membership changes are
    operator-mediated and rare; the existing 60s skill-cache TTL
    absorbs propagation lag without a per-membership signature in
