"""Skills endpoints — Task C1 (filesystem loading) + Task D8 (user shadows).

Implements the read side of the skills surface and the fork operation:

* ``GET /api/v1/skills`` — list summaries. Merges filesystem-canonical
  built-ins with the caller's user-scope skills per ADR 0012; user
  shadows dedupe a built-in on slug collision.
* ``GET /api/v1/skills/{skill_name}`` — full skill detail. Tries the
  caller's user-scope row first (shadow path); falls through to the
  registry's built-in if no shadow exists.
* ``POST /api/v1/skills/{skill_name}/fork`` — copy a built-in's
  content into a fresh user-scope row owned by the caller (D8). The
  ``scope: team`` branch is rejected with a 400 pointing at D8.1.

The owner-scoped management surface for user skills (POST /user-skills,
PATCH, DELETE, list-mine) lives in
:mod:`app.api.user_skills` — that's where the "manage my skills" page
talks to. This module owns the merged picker view.

Auth: per ``app/api/__init__.py`` the skills router is mounted under
``Depends(get_active_user)``, so every handler here inherits the
B1 bearer-token check plus the B2 must-change-password gate.
